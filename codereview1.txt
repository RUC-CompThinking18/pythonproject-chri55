It seems like you're off to a great start here with dealing with the Twitter API. Let's talk in person about whether this is actually working since Twitter is increasingly locking things down. I don't know the tweepy API, but I have dealt with the Twitter API before and everything here seems to be in good order. Two concerns: one, documentation. The level of documentation here is not what was requested in the assignment sheet where I asked for a full, detailed rundown at the beginning of your function. Two, because of that lack of documentation, I'm not sure where what you're doing here fits in with the larger scope of the project. You've gotten the data, but what are you going to do with it now? I recommend actually not stuffing all you're doing here in "main" and instead creating a function that takes a country or region as an argument and can then return the most popular tweets from that area. You're calling this an archive: archives store things over the long term. I don't see how you're planning to do that yet.

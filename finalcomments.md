# Comments
You had a great opening comment that gave an overview of the program itself and its overall flow. You also had really excellent line-by-line comments that talked about what individual lines of code did. I would encourage you to improve your function intro comments to include things like what the types are of the arguments received or returned.
# Code Quality
Your code is streamlined and does what it needs to do in as few lines as possible.
# Ambition
I'll say that this is not just an ambitious project but potentially a necessary one: it could be used as a resource for researchers, journalists, etc. int the future.

However, your README isn't as robust as requested, so that docks you a few points.
